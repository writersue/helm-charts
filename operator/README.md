# PureStorage Helm Operator

# Getting started

## Prerequisites
Openshift(3.11+) or Kubernetes(1.11+) cluster installed and running
You have access to a user account that has cluster-admin privileges

## Installation

A single install script will setup the PSO-operator. 

The install script will do the following:
1. Create New Project
  The script will create a new project (if it does not already exist) with the given namespace. If no namespace parameter is specified 'pure' namespace is used. 
  Openshift Note: In Openshift 3.11 and the default node-selector projects will not allow PSO-operator to mount volumes on master and infra nodes. 
                  If you want to mount volumes on master and infra nodes OR run pods in the default namespace using PSO-volumes then modify the install script as follows:
		   Existing line:     $KUBECTL adm new-project ${NAMESPACE} 
                   Change to allow volume mounts on master and infra nodes:     $KUBECTL adm new-project ${NAMESPACE} --node-selector=""

2. Create a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for the PSO-Operator. 
   The script will wait for the CRD to be published in the cluster. If there is a problem reached the API server to create the CRD the script will time out.

3. Create RBAC rules for the Operator.
The PSO-Operator needs the following Cluster-level Roles and RoleBindings.
| Resource | Permissions | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Namespace | Get | PSO-Operator needs the ability to get created namespaces |
| Storageclass | Create/Delete | Create and cleanup storage classes to be used for Provisioning |
| ClusterRoleBinding | Create/Delete | PSO-Operator needs to create and cleanup a ClusterRoleBinding called 'pure-provisioner-rights' to ClusterRole system:persistent-volume-provisioner for provisioning PVs |
| ClusterRoleBinding | Get permission on ResourceName 'pure-provisioner-rights' | PSO-operator needs the ability to get the ClusterRoleBinding it has created for provisioning. |

In addition the operator needs access to multiple resources in the project/namespace that it is deployed to function correctly. Hence it is recommended to install the PSO-operator in the non-default namespace.
   
4. Creates a deployment for the Operator.
Finally the script will create an deploy the operator using the customized parameters passed in the values.yaml file.


Run the install script as follows:
```install.sh --image=<image> --namespace=<namespace> --orchestrator=<ochestrator> -f <values.yaml>```

Commandline parameters:
image is the PSO-Operator image. If unspecified it will resolve to the released version at quay.io/purestorage/pso-operator
namespace is the namespace/project in which the PSO-operator and its entities will be installed. If unspecified the operator will create and install in 'pure' namespace.
orchestrator will be 'k8s' or 'openshift' depending on which orchestrator is being used. If unspecified 'openshift' is assumed.
values.yaml is the customized helm-chart configuration parameters. This is a required parameter and must contain the list of all backend FlashArrays and FlashBlades. All parameters that need a non-default value must be specified in this file.
